### About the program

This shell script exploits the ultra-fast fasta manipulation tool called [seqkit](https://bioinf.shenwei.me/seqkit/). As argument, the script takes the genome assembly file in fasta format.

--- 

#### The program outputs the following statistical elements:

- `num_scaffolds`: The total number of scaffolds.

- `num_contigs`: The total number of [contigs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contig)

- `total genome length including gaps`: A total of `A's`, `G's`, `T's`, `C's` and `N's` in the assembly.

- `total genome length without gaps`: A total of `A's`, `G's`, `T's`, `C's` in the assembly (`N's` excluded here)

- `avg_scaffold_size incl. gaps`: Mean of the lengths of the assembled scaffolds.

- `avg_contig_size`: Mean of the lengths of the contigs.

- `Contig` [`N50`](https://github.com/lakhujanivijay/Bioinformatics-Scripts/tree/master/Calculate_N50): Contig `N50` is a weighted median statistic such that `50%` of the entire assembly is contained in contigs equal to or larger than this value.

- `Scaffold` `N50`: Scaffold `N50` is a weighted median statistic such that `50%` of the entire assembly is contained in scaffolds equal to or larger than this value.

- `Total gaps`: Total number of `N's` in the assembly.

- `Max scaffold size`: Length of the longest scaffold.

- `Min scaffold size`: Length of the smallest scaffold.

### Usage:
`assembly_stats.sh <assembly.fasta>`

### NOTE:

Before running the script, download and keep seqkit file in the same directory containing the assembly fasta file and this shell script. You can download seqkit [here](https://github.com/shenwei356/seqkit/releases).
