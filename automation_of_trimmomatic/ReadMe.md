### Automation of trimmomatic

---

#### What is Trimmomatic?
[**Trimmomatic**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4103590/) is a fast, multithreaded command line tool that can be used to trim and crop Illumina (FASTQ) data as well as to remove adapters. These adapters can pose a real problem depending on the library preparation and downstream application.

For details, read the manual [here](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic)

#### :scissors: About the script

The script can be used for running trimmomatic automatically for `N` no.of samples regardless of the file extension. Read below to understand the functionalities, usage and reasons for failure.

#### :triangular_flag_on_post: Why should one use this?  

- This script directly works with compressed/uncompressed fastq files exploiting the functionalities of trimmomatic.
- Obviously, it will save a lot of time as trimming is one of the routine tasks and it ought to be automated.
- It is robust and intuitive and errors while execution (if any) are self-explanatory as explained below.

#### :wrench: Using the script: 

Consider you have a directory with a mixture of fastq files with different file extensions

```
    |-- all_R1.fq
    |-- all_R1.fq.gz
    |-- all_R2.fq
    |-- all_R2.fq.gz
    |-- demo_R1.fq
    |-- demo_R2.fq
    |-- make_2_R1.fastq
    |-- make_2_R1.fastq.gz
    |-- make_2_R2.fastq
    |-- make_2_R2.fastq.gz
```

- Example (1):  Running script only for `.fq.gz` files:

  `$ source auto_trimmomatic.sh *.fq.gz`

- Example (2):  Running script only for `.fq` files:

  `$ source auto_trimmomatic.sh *.fq`

- Example (3):  Running script only for `.fastq` files:

  `$ source auto_trimmomatic.sh *.fastq`

- Example (4):  Running script only for `.fastq.gz` files:

  `$ source auto_trimmomatic.sh *.fastq.gz`

- Example (5):  Running script only for all files in the directory:

  `$ source auto_trimmomatic.sh *`

#### :information_source: Invoking help

`$ source auto_trimmomatic.sh --help` OR

`$ source auto_trimmomatic.sh -h`

#### :warning: Error handling

- No parameters passed to script
```
[mypc]$ source auto_trimmomatic.sh 
Error: No parameter(s) provided
Usage: sh auto_trim [*.extension]
       extension: <fq> or <fastq> or <fq.gz> or <fastq.gz> or <*>
       example: sh auto_trim.sh *.fq.gz or sh auto_trim.sh *
 
Help:  source auto_trimmomatic.sh -h or --help
```

- No files in the directory with user provided extension
```
[mypc]$ source auto_trimmomatic.sh *.fq

FileNotFoundError: No such file with extension *.fq found!
Supported extensions are: <.fq> or <.fastq> or <.fq.gz> or <.fastq.gz>
```

- Fastq file names do not have `R1 - R2` naming conventions.
 Say if you have files like these - `demo_1.fq`, `demo_2.fq`, the script will fail:
```
[mypc]$ source auto_trimmomatic.sh *.fq

Filename Error: Paired end file names should contain _R1 _R2
Example: test_R1.fq.gz, test_R2.fq.gz
```

##### :information_source: _Rename the fastq files as `demo_R1.fq`, `demo_R2.fq`. This checkpoint was essential to maintain integrity of the script._
